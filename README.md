# 🐍 Snake Game using Python Turtle

A classic Snake Game built using Python's built-in turtle graphics module.
This project demonstrates core programming concepts like game loops, collision detection, keyboard controls, score tracking, and dynamic object creation.

## 🎮 Game Preview

## 🚀 Features

-  Smooth snake movement using arrow keys

-  Random food generation with random shapes & colors

-  Live score and high score tracking

-  Wall collision detection

-  Self-collision detection

- Increasing difficulty as score increases

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3

- Built-in turtle module

- random module

- time module

- No external libraries required 

## 📦 How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.


3️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:

cd snake-game

4️⃣ Run the game:

- python snake.py

## 🎯 How to Play

- Use Arrow Keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to move the snake

- Eat the food to grow longer

- Avoid hitting the walls

- Avoid colliding with your own body

- Try to beat your High Score

## 📚 What I Learned

- Handling keyboard input in Python

- Implementing a continuous game loop

- Collision detection logic

- Managing dynamic lists (snake body segments)

- Updating UI elements in real-time

- Improving problem-solving and logical thinking

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Uses object-oriented style with turtle objects

- Dynamic speed increase as score grows

- Clean and structured game logic

- Beginner-friendly but demonstrates strong fundamentals
